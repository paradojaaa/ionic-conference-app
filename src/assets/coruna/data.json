Estudió artes gráfico plásticas y corte y confección, pero no se quedó ahí, ya que gracias al cosplay descubrió que el maquillaje se había convertido en una de sus pasiones, por lo que también se dispuso a hacer varios cursos relacionados con todo ese mundo. También ha ganado varios concursos locales de cosplay pero dentro de su carrera cosplayer lo más remarcable es que ha llegado a trabajar como cosplayer para Nintendo en varias ocasiones y actualmente está envuelta en un proyecto en conjunto con Mediatoon (distribuidora de Código Lyoko).",

En sus trajes refleja su formación, ya que ha estudiado confección y patronaje, cosa por la cual admite que su parte favorita del proceso de creación del cosplay recae en la costura, aunque también disfruta de dar color a las props que lleve el personaje. Ha ganado premios y menciones en diversos eventos en categoría pasarela y concurso de Cosplay con actuación. Aunque finalmente, lo que sin duda más le gusta es lo orgulloso que se siente al final, cuando al fin finaliza su cosplay y ve lo que es capaz de hacer.",

El cosplay es uno de sus hobbys predilectos: llevan en esto desde 2011 y no tienen intención de parar. A pesar de ser una afición como cualquier otra, ¡se la tomamos bastante en serio! Disfrutan creando cada parte de sus cosplays: han hecho un poco de todo (props, armaduras, costura, pelucas…) y les encanta probar técnicas nuevas para elaborar trajes cada vez más complejos. A pesar de esto, intentan que tengan los mejores acabados posibles y les gusta más un cosplay simple pero bien hecho que uno más grande con muchos defectos al mirarlo de cerca.",
